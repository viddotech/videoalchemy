Command ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text='Your Text Here':fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=10\" output.mp4 Parameters -i input.mp4 : Specifies the input video file. Replace input.mp4 with the path to your source video file. -vf \"drawtext=text='Your Text Here':fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=10\" : Applies the drawtext video filter with options to overlay text on the video: text='Your Text Here' : The text to overlay on the video. Replace 'Your Text Here' with your desired text. fontcolor=white : Sets the color of the text. Replace white with any valid color name or hex code. fontsize=24 : Sets the size of the text. Adjust 24 to your desired font size. x=10:y=10 : Positions the text 10 pixels from the left ( x ) and 10 pixels from the top ( y ) of the video frame. Adjust these values to change the text position. Possible Errors File not found : Occurs if FFmpeg cannot locate the input file. Ensure the path to the file is correct. Invalid filter options : Happens if options passed to the drawtext filter are incorrect or unsupported. Verify the syntax and values for all filter options. Font not found : Arises if the specified font is not available on your system. Specify a font file directly with the fontfile option or ensure the font name is correct. Permission denied : Occurs if FFmpeg does not have the necessary permissions to read the input file or write to the output file. Check that the files and directories have the correct permissions. Additional Information Customizing Text Appearance : Beyond font size and color, the drawtext filter supports various options for customizing text appearance, including fontfile (to specify a custom font), shadowcolor , shadowx , shadowy (for text shadows), and box (to add a background box behind the text). Dynamic Text Placement : For more dynamic text placement, FFmpeg supports expressions for the x and y parameters, such as x=(w-text_w)/2 to center the text horizontally. Timecode Overlay : The drawtext filter can display dynamic content like the current timecode using special variables and expressions, e.g., text='%{pts\\:hms}' for a running timestamp. Performance : Adding a text overlay is relatively lightweight, but re-encoding the video can affect processing time, especially for videos that are high-resolution or long.","title":"Adding a simple text overlay to a video"},{"location":"ffmpeg-commands/adding-a-simple-text-overlay-to-a-video/#adding-a-simple-text-overlay-to-a-video","text":"Embed a text overlay onto a video file using FFmpeg's drawtext filter, ideal for watermarking, titles, or annotations.","title":"Adding a Simple Text Overlay to a Video"},{"location":"ffmpeg-commands/adding-a-simple-text-overlay-to-a-video/#command","text":"ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text='Your Text Here':fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=10\" output.mp4","title":"Command"},{"location":"ffmpeg-commands/adding-a-simple-text-overlay-to-a-video/#parameters","text":"-i input.mp4 : Specifies the input video file.

Replace input.mp4 with the path to your source video file. -i watermark.png : Specifies the watermark image file. Replace watermark.png with the path to your watermark image. The image format can be PNG, JPG, or any other image format supported by FFmpeg. -filter_complex \"overlay=10:10\" : Applies a complex filter to overlay the watermark image onto the video. 10:10 positions the top-left corner of the watermark image 10 pixels from the top and 10 pixels from the left of the video frame. Adjust these values to change the watermark position. Possible Errors File not found : Occurs if FFmpeg cannot locate the input video file or the watermark image file. Ensure all file paths are correct. Invalid overlay position : Occurs if the specified position values for the overlay filter are outside the bounds of the video frame. Ensure the position values are within the video dimensions. Permission denied : Occurs if FFmpeg does not have the necessary permissions to read the input files or write to the output file. Ensure that the files and directories have the correct permissions. GPU Acceleration Command While adding a watermark is primarily a CPU-bound process, you can utilize GPU acceleration for the video encoding part of the process. For Nvidia GPUs: ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i watermark.png -filter_complex \"overlay=10:10\" -c:v h264_nvenc output.mp4 Additional Information Transparency Support : If your watermark is a PNG with transparency, FFmpeg will respect this transparency in the output video. Watermark Size : If necessary, you can resize the watermark image before overlaying it onto the video using the scale filter within the -filter_complex option (e.g., overlay=10:10,scale=100:50 to resize the watermark to 100x50 pixels). Positioning the Watermark : The overlay filter allows for dynamic positioning using variables such as main_w , main_h (video width and height), and overlay_w , overlay_h (watermark width and height). For example, overlay=(main_w-overlay_w-10):(main_h-overlay_h-10) positions the watermark 10 pixels from the bottom right corner. Fade In/Out Effects : To add fade-in and fade-out effects to your watermark, you can use the fade filter in combination with the overlay filter within the -filter_complex option.","title":"Adding a watermark to a video"},{"location":"ffmpeg-commands/adding-a-watermark-to-a-video/#adding-a-watermark-to-a-video","text":"Embed a watermark image onto a video file using FFmpeg to brand or copyright protect your video content.","title":"Adding a Watermark to a Video"},{"location":"ffmpeg-commands/adding-a-watermark-to-a-video/#command","text":"ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i watermark.png -filter_complex \"overlay=10:10\" output.mp4","title":"Command"},{"location":"ffmpeg-commands/adding-a-watermark-to-a-video/#parameters","text":"-i input.mp4 : Specifies the input video file.
