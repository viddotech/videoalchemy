# Capturing Webcam to a Video File

Record video from a webcam directly to a file using FFmpeg, allowing for easy creation of video content or video calls recordings.

## VideoAlchemy Compose File

```yaml
version: 1

generate_path: "./generated"

tasks:
  - name: Capturing Webcam to a Video File
    command: ffmpeg
    inputs:
      - id: input_2
        source: '/dev/video0'
    outputs:
      - id: output_2
        overwrite: true
        source: 'output.mp4'
    codecs:
      - codec_name:
          video: v4l2
```


## Command (Linux)

```bash
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 output.mp4
```


## Command (Windows)

```bash
ffmpeg -f dshow -i video="Your Webcam Name" output.mp4
```

## Parameters (Linux)

- **`-f v4l2`**: Specifies the video4linux2 (v4l2) format, used for capturing video on Linux systems.
- **`-i /dev/video0`**: Indicates the input device, typically your webcam. `/dev/video0` is a common default, but this may vary depending on your system and number of video devices.

## Parameters (Windows)

- **`-f dshow`**: Specifies the DirectShow format, used for capturing video on Windows systems.
- **`-i video="Your Webcam Name"`**: Indicates the input device, which is your webcam. Replace `"Your Webcam Name"` with the exact name of your webcam, which can be found by running `ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy`.

## Possible Errors

- **Device not found**: Occurs if FFmpeg cannot access the webcam device. Ensure the device path or name is correct and that your system grants access to the webcam.
- **Permission denied**: Arises if FFmpeg does not have the necessary permissions to access the webcam. This can be due to privacy settings or permissions on your system.
- **Unsupported format or codec**: Happens if the output format or codec is not supported by the webcam or FFmpeg. Ensure the chosen codecs are compatible with your recording requirements and hardware capabilities.

## Additional Information

- **Selecting the Right Device**: On systems with multiple video devices, you may need to identify the correct device file (Linux) or device name (Windows). Use tools like `v4l2-ctl --list-devices` on Linux or the DirectShow command mentioned above on Windows to list available devices.
- **Quality and File Size**: You can control the quality and size of the output video by adjusting encoding parameters such as bit rate (`-b:v`) and resolution (`-s`). Higher quality settings will result in larger files.
- **Audio Recording**: To include audio in your recording, add an audio input source to your FFmpeg command. On Windows, for example, use `-f dshow -i audio="Your Microphone Name"` alongside the video input.
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensure you have permission to record if capturing video in a setting with other individuals or sensitive information. Always be mindful of privacy and legal considerations.
