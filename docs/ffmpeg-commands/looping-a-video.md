# Looping a Video

Create a looped version of a video file using FFmpeg, repeating the content for a specified number of times or duration.

## VideoAlchemy Compose File

```yaml
version: 1

generate_path: "./generated"

tasks:
  - name: Looping a Video
    command: ffmpeg
    inputs:
      - id: input_1
        source: 'input.mp4'
    streams:
      - stream_loop: -1
        codec_name:
          video: copy
          audio: copy
        shortest: true
    outputs:
      - id: output_1
        overwrite: true
        source: 'output.mp4'
```


## Command

```bash
ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -i input.mp4 -c copy -shortest output.mp4
```


## Parameters

- **`-stream_loop -1`**: Loops the input video infinitely. Replace `-1` with a specific number (e.g., `5`) to loop the video a fixed number of times.
- **`-i input.mp4`**: Specifies the input video file. Replace `input.mp4` with the path to your source video file.
- **`-c copy`**: Copies the video and audio streams without re-encoding, preserving the original quality.
- **`-shortest`**: Makes the output file duration equal to the shortest input stream (useful when combining with audio that may not match the exact loop duration).

## Possible Errors

- **File not found**: Occurs if FFmpeg cannot locate the input file. Ensure the path to the file is correct.
- **Infinite loop**: If the `-stream_loop` option is set to `-1` without setting a duration limit or using `-shortest`, FFmpeg may attempt to create an infinitely long file. Ensure your command includes appropriate limiting parameters.
- **Permission denied**: Arises if FFmpeg does not have the necessary permissions to read the input file or write to the output file. Check that the files and directories have the correct permissions.

## GPU Acceleration Command

Looping a video involves primarily stream manipulation rather than encoding, so GPU acceleration does not directly apply. However, if you need to re-encode the video for any reason (e.g., changing format or size), you can incorporate GPU acceleration for the encoding process. For Nvidia GPUs:

```bash
ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -i input.mp4 -c:v h264_nvenc -c:a copy -shortest output.mp4
```


## Additional Information

- **Audio Looping**: If your video has audio, consider the audio length and how it aligns with the video loop. Misalignment may result in abrupt audio cuts or mismatches between video and audio loops.
- **File Size**: Looping a video multiple times will increase the file size proportionally. Consider this when planning storage or streaming bandwidth.
- **Re-encoding vs. Copying**: Using `-c copy` preserves quality but limits format changes. If you need to change the video or audio codec, specify the codec with `-c:v` for video and `-c:a` for audio, and be aware this will involve re-encoding.
- **Complex Looping**: For more complex looping scenarios, such as looping a segment of a video or integrating loops with non-looped content, you may need to use more advanced FFmpeg features or scripts to create the desired output.
