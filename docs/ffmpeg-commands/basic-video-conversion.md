# Basic Video Conversion

Convert video files from one format to another using various tools.

## VideoAlchemy Compose File
 
```yaml
version: 1

generate_path: "./generated"

tasks:
  - name: Basic Video Conversion
    command: ffmpeg
    inputs:
      - id: input_1
        source: 'input.mp4'
    outputs:
      - id: output_avi
        overwrite: true
        source: 'output.avi'
```

## FFmpeg Command

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.avi
```

### Parameters for FFmpeg

- **`-i input.mp4`**: Specifies the input file. Replace `input.mp4` with the path to your source video file.
- **`output.avi`**: Specifies the output file. The extension of the output file determines the output format. Replace `output.avi` with your desired output file name and format.

### Possible Errors for FFmpeg

- **File not found**: Occurs if FFmpeg cannot locate the input file. Ensure the path to the file is correct.
- **Unsupported codec**: Occurs if the output format requires a codec not supported or not installed. Ensure that the desired output format is supported.
- **Permission denied**: Occurs if FFmpeg does not have the necessary permissions to read the input file or write to the output file. Ensure that the files and directories have the correct permissions.

### GPU Acceleration Command for FFmpeg

For Nvidia GPUs, use:

```bash
ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -i input.mp4 -c:v h264_nvenc output.avi
```

## GStreamer Command

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=input.mp4 ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! x264enc ! avimux ! filesink location=output.avi
```

### Parameters for GStreamer

- **`filesrc location=input.mp4`**: Specifies the source file.
- **`videoconvert`**: Converts video formats for compatibility.
- **`x264enc`**: Uses the x264 encoder for H.264 video encoding.
- **`avimux`**: Muxes streams into an AVI container.
- **`filesink location=output.avi`**: Specifies the destination file.

### Possible Errors for GStreamer

- **Pipeline configuration error**: Occurs if there's an issue with how the pipeline is set up or if a necessary plugin is missing.
- **Unsupported codec or format**: Similar to FFmpeg, if the pipeline uses codecs or formats not supported by GStreamer or not installed on the system.
- **File read/write error**: If GStreamer cannot access the source or destination files due to permissions or if the destination path is incorrect.

## OpenCV Command

Using OpenCV for video conversion requires writing a small script. Here's an example in Python:

```python
import cv2

# Load the input video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('input.mp4')

# Define the codec and create VideoWriter object
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'DIVX')
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output.avi', fourcc, 20.0, (640, 480))

while(cap.isOpened()):
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Write the frame into the file 'output.avi'
    out.write(frame)

# Release everything if job is finished
cap.release()
out.release()
```

### Possible Errors for OpenCV

- **Codec not supported**: If the specified codec is not available on the system, OpenCV will fail to write the video file.
- **Incorrect file path**: If the path to the input file or the destination for the output file is incorrect, OpenCV will not be able to open or save the file.
- **Frame capture error**: During video processing, if OpenCV cannot read frames from the video, it might stop the conversion process prematurely.

## libVLC Command

Converting video files with libVLC also typically involves scripting. Below is an example command using the VLC command line:

```bash
vlc -I dummy input.mp4 vlc://quit --sout "#transcode{vcodec=h264,vb=800,acodec=mp3,ab=128}:standard{access=file,mux=avi,dst='output.avi'}"
```

### Parameters for libVLC

- **`-I dummy`**: Runs VLC without an interface.
- **`input.mp4`**: Specifies the input file.
- **`--sout`**: Defines the stream output chain.
- **`vcodec=h264,vb=800`**: Sets the video codec to H.264 with a bitrate of 800 kb/s.
- **`acodec=mp3,ab=128`**: Sets the audio codec to MP3 with a bitrate of 128 kb/s.
- **`mux=avi`**: Uses AVI as the muxing format.
- **`dst='output.avi'`**: Specifies the destination file.

### Possible Errors for libVLC

- **Unsupported codec or format**: If VLC does not support the specified codec or format for the input or output files.
- **Streaming error**: When using VLC for streaming or converting streaming media, network issues or incorrect stream URLs can cause errors.
- **Permission issues**: Similar to other tools, if VLC lacks permissions to access the input file or write to the output location, it can result in errors.

## Additional Information

### FFmpeg
- **Codecs and Formats**: The output format is determined by the file extension of the output file (e.g., `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`). The codec used for encoding can be specified with the `-c:v` parameter (e.g., `-c:v libx264` for H.264).
- **Quality and Compression**: You can control the quality and compression of the output video by adjusting the bitrate (using `-b:v`) or the constant rate factor (using `-crf` for codecs like H.264).
- **Audio**: By default, FFmpeg will also transcode the audio stream. You can specify the audio codec with `-c:a` (e.g., `-c:a aac` for AAC audio) and adjust the audio bitrate with `-b:a`.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the chosen codecs and formats are compatible with your intended playback devices or platforms.

### GStreamer
- **Codecs and Formats**: Uses a pipeline-based approach for handling various codecs and formats. The encoding process is determined by the elements in the pipeline (e.g., x264enc for H.264 encoding).
- **Quality and Compression**: Allows for dynamic adjustment of quality and compression settings within the pipeline. Parameters like bitrate can be specified for certain encoders.
- **Audio**: Supports audio processing and encoding through its pipeline. Audio codecs and parameters can be specified similar to video settings.
- **Compatibility**: Modular architecture enables support for a wide range of codecs and formats, ensuring compatibility across different platforms and devices.

### OpenCV
- **Codecs and Formats**: Limited by system codecs but supports common formats for reading and writing videos. The codec is specified in the VideoWriter constructor (e.g., `cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'DIVX')` for AVI).
- **Quality and Compression**: Offers control over the video's resolution and frame rate, which can indirectly affect quality and size.
- **Audio**: Does not natively support audio processing; OpenCV focuses primarily on video and image processing.
- **Compatibility**: Works well for a wide range of video processing tasks, but compatibility with codecs and formats is dependent on the underlying system.

### libVLC
- **Codecs and Formats**: Supports a broad range of codecs and formats for both input and output, leveraging VLC's extensive format support.
- **Quality and Compression**: Quality and compression settings can be adjusted through transcode module options, like specifying video bitrate and scale.
- **Audio**: Offers comprehensive audio processing capabilities, including codec selection and bitrate adjustments, similar to its video processing features.
- **Compatibility**: Highly compatible with numerous devices and platforms, benefiting from VLC's universal media playback capabilities.
