# Increase the Volume of a Video

Enhance the audio level within a video file using FFmpeg, ideal for videos with low audio levels or when you want to emphasize certain audio elements.

## VideoAlchemy Compose File

```yaml
version: 1

generate_path: "./generated"

tasks:
  - name: Increase the Volume of a Video
    command: ffmpeg
    inputs:
      - id: input_1
        source: 'input.mp4'
    streams:
      - audio_filters:
          - name: volume
            value: 2.0
    outputs:
      - id: output_1
        overwrite: true
        source: 'output.mp4'
```

## Command

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:a "volume=2.0" output.mp4
```

## Parameters

- `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input video file. Replace `input.mp4` with the path to your source video file.
- `-filter:a "volume=2.0"`: Applies an audio filter to adjust the volume. The value `2.0` doubles the current audio volume. Adjust this value as needed to increase or decrease the volume.

## Possible Errors

- **File not found**: Occurs if FFmpeg cannot locate the input file. Make sure the file path is correct.
- **Invalid filter expression**: Happens if the expression passed to the volume filter is incorrect. Ensure the syntax for the filter expression is correct.
- **Permission denied**: Arises if FFmpeg does not have the necessary permissions to read the input file or write to the output file. Check that the files and directories have the correct permissions.

## Additional Information

- **Volume Adjustment**: The volume filter's value can be set to any decimal number. Values greater than `1.0` increase the volume, while values less than `1.0` decrease it.
- **Clipping Warning**: Significantly increasing the volume may lead to audio clipping, resulting in distortion. Use the volume filter judiciously and test the output to ensure audio quality.
- **Normalization**: If the goal is to achieve consistent volume levels across multiple videos, consider using the `loudnorm` filter for normalization.
- **Dynamic Range Compression**: For videos with a wide range of audio levels, applying dynamic range compression along with volume adjustment can maintain clarity without distortion.
